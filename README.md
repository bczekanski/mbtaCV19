# mbtaCV19

This project looks at MBTA gated station entries over the roughly 2017-2020 period and compares ridership and hopefully create some neat visualizations of recent trends, potentially showing any dropoff in ridership due to the COVID19 coronavirus.

I am still getting used to python and this is a work in progress so I would appreciate any constructive criticism that people have.

The data for this project comes from https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/mbta-gated-station-entries/geoservice?orderBy=service_date and is downloaded in csv form. Potentially I would like to interact with the API they have there but for now replicating this analysis requires downloading the csv file. It looks like the January 2020 data was published on 2/21/20, so if we believe that there is not a significant dropoff in ridership in February, then we may not have data showing a dropoff until mid-April.
